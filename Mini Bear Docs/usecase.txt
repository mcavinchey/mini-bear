WAY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL - DAN
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY

In our use case, we had several key requirements:

1. Allow anyone (not just registered users) to follow certain site content updates
2. Require e-mail validation for anyone signing up, along with CAPTCHA validation to keep spam to a minimum
3. Allow followers to check boxes to specifically follow one, or many, different types of content updates
4. The allowed types of content updates would be negotiated, then set up by IT
5. An email would go out whenever an update occurred, either with the content included in the email body, or as a teaser with a link to the content
6. The content may include a single instance of content, or feature a list of recent (or highlighted) content
